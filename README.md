# Customer-Market-Segmentation-Using-Unsuperwised-Machine-Learning
Customer Market Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Project Completed in The Following Step

Step:- 1, First of all, we Understand the problem Statements.

Step:- 2 Import the Following library like Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and sklearns library and Datasets as well as Cleaning the Data, Seen Inside of Data, Drop some column, Replace the blank Value (NA ) From the Dataset.

Step:- 3 Visualization of data == How the Datasets Look Like with the help of Seaborn and Matplot, perform Standard Scaling on the dataset, Correlation of dataset, or find any Missing Dataset.

Step:-4 Elbow method works: How to select the Optimal number of Clustered.

Step:- 5 Apply the KMeans method to our dataset for Standard and scaled dataset and then Predicted labels

Steps:- Visualization of Data By Using PCA (Principle Component Analysis) In the Form Of Scattered plot.
